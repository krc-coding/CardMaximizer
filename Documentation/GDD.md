# Game Design Document

## 1 game overview

**Titel:**  
Card Maximizer

**Genre:** Procedural Puzzle Card Game

**Platform:**  
PC

**Short description of the game:**  
It's a game about winning, over the opponent, but also winning over the rules, as the rules aren't gaurenteed.  
All you know is that there will be rules, but not which.

---

## 2 Games purpose

It's about having fun, playing without knowing what the next game will be like.  
Everything in the game is based on the rules drawn, and is all about beating the rules drawn for a game.

---

## 3 Core Gameplay Loop

The core of the game is the randomly drawn rules at the start of each game, making it so that no 2 games should be
identical.  
But the one thing that is consistent across all games, is that you're trying to beat the rules.

**The player's repeated actions:**

1. Player starts a new game ‚Üí Random rules are drawn and revealed
2. Player receives initial hand of cards
3. Player and AI opponent take turns playing cards according to the drawn rules
4. Game evaluates win/loss condition based on the active rules
5. Player receives feedback on performance and returns to step 1 with new rules

**Core Loop:**
- Draw rules ‚Üí Learn rules ‚Üí Play strategically ‚Üí Adapt to rules ‚Üí Win or lose ‚Üí Draw new rules

The satisfaction comes from both mastering individual rule sets and developing the skill to quickly adapt to unknown combinations.

## 4 Regler og Mekanikker

**Meta-Rules (Always Apply):**
- At the start of each game, 3-5 random rules are drawn from a rule pool
- Rules are revealed to both player and AI before the first turn
- The player always goes first
- Each player has a hand of cards and draws from their deck
- The game ends when a win condition (defined by the active rules) is met

**Variable Rules (Examples of what might be drawn):**
- **Win Conditions:** "First to play 5 red cards wins" / "Highest total value after 10 rounds wins" / "First to empty their hand wins"
- **Card Play Rules:** "Only play cards in ascending order" / "Must alternate colors" / "Can play 2 cards per turn"
- **Special Actions:** "Discard and draw 3 cards once per game" / "Skip opponent's turn by playing a matching pair"
- **Scoring Modifiers:** "Face cards are worth double" / "Odd numbers score negative"
- **Deck Rules:** "Start with 7 cards" / "Draw 2 cards per turn" / "No reshuffling discard pile"

**Core Mechanics:**
- Turn-based card play
- Hand management
- Strategic decision-making based on active rules
- Adapting strategy mid-game as you learn the rule interactions

üí¨ *The challenge comes from quickly understanding how the random rules interact and finding the optimal strategy within those constraints.*

## 5 Spilverden og Tema

**Setting:**  
The game takes place on a worn wooden table in a cozy game enthusiast's home. The environment feels lived-in and nostalgic, with incomplete board games on shelves in the background, dice scattered around, and warm ambient lighting from a nearby lamp.

**Atmosphere:**
- Relaxed and contemplative, like a quiet evening of cards
- Slightly mysterious due to the unknown rules each game
- Aged aesthetic inspired by *Inscryption* - weathered cards, vintage furniture
- Comfortable and inviting, not stressful or rushed

**Visual Style:**
- Warm, muted color palette (browns, creams, soft lighting)
- Cards show natural wear and aging
- UI elements have a hand-written or stamped appearance
- Soft shadows and gentle animations

üí¨ *The theme supports the gameplay by creating a space where experimentation feels safe and discovery feels rewarding. The "incomplete games" theme justifies why rules are always changing - you're playing with mixed rule sets from different games.*

## 8 Level Design og Progression

**Game-to-Game Progression:**
- **Early Games (Tutorial Phase):**
    - 2-3 simple rules that don't interact much
    - Common win conditions (total points, first to X)
    - AI plays conservatively

- **Mid Progression:**
    - 3-4 rules with some interaction
    - More variety in rule combinations
    - AI adapts to complex rules better

- **Advanced Games:**
    - 4-5 rules that create interesting interactions
    - Rare/unusual rules appear more often
    - AI plays optimally

**Within a Single Game:**
- Each game is relatively short (3-10 minutes)
- Tension builds as win conditions approach
- Strategic depth emerges as players understand rule interactions

**Long-term Progression:**
- **Statistics Tracking:** Win rate, favorite rule combinations, total games played
- **Rule Unlocks:** Start with ~20 rules, unlock more (up to 50+) through play
- **Difficulty Settings:** Adjust AI skill level
- **Daily Challenges:** Pre-set rule combinations for consistent challenge

**Progression Philosophy:**
- No grinding or mandatory progression
- Players improve through understanding, not upgrades
- New rules add variety, not power
- Each game stands alone but long-term play reveals mastery

üí¨ *The progression system rewards adaptation skills rather than memorization, keeping each game fresh while building player competence.*

## 10 Game Design Overvejelser

### üéØ 1. Spillets id√© og form√•l

**What experience do I want to create?**
- A game about adaptation rather than memorization
- The satisfaction of solving a unique puzzle every game
- "Aha!" moments when players discover rule interactions
- Relaxed experimentation without fear of long-term consequences
- The feeling of mastery that comes from strategic flexibility

**Core Design Philosophy:**
- Replayability through randomness with depth
- Accessibility through clarity, not simplicity

---

### üïπÔ∏è 2. Valg for spilleren

**What choices does the player make?**
- **Before Each Turn:** Which card(s) to play from hand
- **Strategic:** When to pursue aggressive vs. defensive play
- **Risk Management:** Whether to use special actions now or save them
- **Adaptation:** How quickly to shift strategy when initial approach fails
- **Meta:** Which difficulty to play at, when to start a new game

**Why these choices matter:**
- Every card play affects future options
- Rules create multiple paths to victory
- Good choices feel smart, bad choices are learning opportunities
- No single "correct" answer due to random elements

---

### ‚öñÔ∏è 3. Udfordring og balance

**How do I keep the game engaging but not frustrating?**

**Difficulty Balancing:**
- Rules are revealed upfront (no hidden information to memorize)
- Starting games use simpler rule combinations
- AI difficulty can be adjusted
- Games are short, so failure isn't punishing

**Fair Challenge:**
- Player and AI follow identical rules
- Random card draws are neutral (both players face same variance)
- Complex rule combinations appear gradually
- Some rule combinations are hand-crafted to avoid unfun scenarios

**Preventing Frustration:**
- Clear visual feedback shows why a move is illegal
- Tutorial phase teaches core concepts
- Can restart quickly if a game feels unwinnable
- Statistics show overall improvement, not just individual losses

### üîÅ 4. Gentagelse og rytme

**What makes the game fun to repeat?**

**Short-term Loop (Single Game):**
- Quick turns keep momentum
- New information each turn (cards drawn, opponent's plays)
- Building toward clear goal
- Games end before becoming tedious (3-10 minutes)

**Medium-term Loop (Session):**
- Each new game has different rules = fresh puzzle
- Victories feel earned, defeats feel like learning
- "Just one more game" factor from wanting to try new rules
- No lengthy setup or commitment needed

**Long-term Loop (Many Sessions):**
- Gradually encountering new rule combinations
- Mastering understanding of rule interactions
- Improving win rate against harder AI
- Discovering favorite rule types and strategies

**Variety Within Repetition:**
- ~20-50 different rules = thousands of combinations
- Same rules feel different with different card draws
- AI adapts, preventing pattern exploitation

### üí≠ 10. Hvad har du l√¶rt om spil-design?

**What have I discovered during development?**

*(To be filled during development - key lessons)*

**About Random Systems:**
- Randomness needs clear communication to feel fair
- Players accept randomness when both sides face it equally
- "Controlled randomness" (curated rule pools) better than pure chaos

**About Adaptation Gameplay:**
- Players need time to process rules before action
- Visual clarity is more important than visual flash
- Tutorial must teach "how to adapt" not just "these specific rules"

**About Replayability:**
- Variety alone isn't enough - must create meaningful differences
- Short games + high variety = strong "one more game" pull
- Player mastery should be about skills, not memorization

**About Single-Player Card Games:**
- AI needs to feel intelligent but not psychic
- Players need to feel they could have won with better play
- Balance between luck and skill is delicate

*(Add more observations during development)*
