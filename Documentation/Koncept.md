# Concept idea

## 🎮 Title:

Card Maximizer

## 📖 Theme and world

The theme of the game is "Incomplete games" and it's set in a game enthusiast home, where there are lots of games but none of them are complete.

## 🎯 Purpose and goal

The purpose of the game is to have fun, playing cards games.  
The goal is to beat the rules.

## 🕹️ Gameplay and Mechanics

The game plays out as any other cards, but the actions the players takes, changes depending on the rules of the current game.  
The game contains stratigic and chance elements, but it ultimately depends on the given rules of a game. 

## 👥 Target audience

My target is to make a game that can be played by all interested in card games.  
One of my main interests is that it's easy to get into for new players, without it being annoying for long time players.

## 🎨 Setting and style

It's intended to have an older feeling, where the items seem aged without being broken.  
I have taken some inspiration from the game "Inscryption", as that game also have this older feeling.  
I want the game to be relaxing, where you just do what feels right without, having to think too much about strategy, and
also not be stressed about getting good luck.

## 💡 Uniqueness

You don't know what rules you're playing with before starting to play.
